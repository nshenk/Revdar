Live map of protests around the world written in html, js, and css, and using leaflet.js, openstreetmaps, GDELT API, and NASA images.

Currently writing an army of bots and some classification/regression to replace the GDELT API, resulting in data that is as live and accurate as possible, with more info on the popup cards.
